\f0\fs24 \cf0 Readme : \
The project was made on Java on the Eclipse IDE. The library used was BURLAP. On this IDE, only this library was needed.\
\
But all files were processed in R.\
\
The packages that need to be installed are : -ggplot2\
								   - gridExtra\
\
In order to compute the code, download the code file, 2 files are available : \
\
- markovDecisionProcesses containing : \
Only the src was modified and in the src -> burlap only assignment4 which contains the classes for the 2 problems : \
				- BasicGridWorld.java\
				- EasyGridWorldLauncher.java\
				- HardGridWorldLauncher.java\
\
- R code  containing : -curves_easy_grid_world.R : for plotting the different algorithms for easy grid\
				 - curves_hard_grid_world.R : for plotting the different algorithms for hard grid\
				 - comparison_grid_world.R :  for comparing the two grids over the 3 algorithms}
